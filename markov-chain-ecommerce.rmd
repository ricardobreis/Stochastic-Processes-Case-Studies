```{r}
# Limpando o console.

# Limpando o Global Environment.

# Carregando o pacote markovchain.

```{r}
#install.packages("markovchain")
library(markovchain)
```

# Para o caso de transição de canais de um e-commerce.

Definindo a matriz de transição.

```{r}
tm <- matrix(c(0.00,0.10,0.10,0.20, 0.60,
               0.15,0.00,0.05,0.35, 0.45,
               0.20,0.10,0.00,0.13, 0.57,
               0.00,0.00,0.00,1.00, 0.00,
               0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, 1.00),
              nrow = 5,
              byrow = TRUE) 
tm
```

Criando a DTMC.

```{r}
dtmc <- new("markovchain",transitionMatrix=tm,
states=c("Site","Hotpage", "Call Center","Venda","Saida"),
name="MarkovChain para o e-commerce") 
dtmc
```

Caso 1: Iniciando pelo site

```{r}
initialState<-c(1,0,0,0,0)
steps<-1
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(1,0,0,0,0)
steps<-2
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(1,0,0,0,0)
steps<-3
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(1,0,0,0,0)
steps<-1000
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

Caso 2: Iniciando pela hotpage

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,1,0,0,0)
steps<-1
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,1,0,0,0)
steps<-2
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,1,0,0,0)
steps<-3
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,1,0,0,0)
steps<-1000
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

Caso 3: Iniciando pelo call center

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,0,1,0,0)
steps<-1
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,0,1,0,0)
steps<-2
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,0,1,0,0)
steps<-3
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

```{r}
initialState<-c(0,0,1,0,0)
steps<-1000
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```

Estima-se o estado assintótico para uma determinada distribuição de probabilidade de início.

Caso 50% dos clientes sejam "originados" por procura orgânica no Site, 20% pela Hotpage e 30% pelo Call Center.

```{r}
initialState<-c(0.50,0.20,0.30,0.00,0.00)
steps<-1000
finalState<-initialState*(dtmc^steps) #using power operator
finalState
```
